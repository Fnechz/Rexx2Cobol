# Rexx2Cobol
A simple, effective and extensible Rexx script that generates useful COBOL routines using ZOWE CLI

This script was part of my Grand challenge project in the IBM Master the Mainframe programming contest in 2020,
where I was one of the 12 Global winners.
To use the script you must have access to a Mainframe working environment which you can easily get access to by visition ibm.com website.
